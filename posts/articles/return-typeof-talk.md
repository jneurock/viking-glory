I recently spoke at the Ember.js Meetup in Portland, OR on June 17th, 2014. My talk was about types and how understanding them better can lead to new problem-solving ideas as well as understanding some of the more advanced concepts that are often discussed in the Ember community.

I uploaded my slides at [http://slides.com/rockyneurock/return-typeof-talk](http://slides.com/rockyneurock/return-typeof-talk). I created a small demo application to accompany the talk and the source code is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/jneurock/return-typeof-talk](https://github.com/jneurock/return-typeof-talk).
