excerpt: Ember 1.10 has been released. See this [blog post](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/02/07/ember-1-10-0-released.html). Since Ember 1.10 fixed my IE 8 issues with HTML5 tags, see [this post](http://vikingglory.com/articles/viking-base-update), I've updated the [Viking Base](https://github.com/jneurock/viking-base) project to include Ember 1.10 (as well as some minor API tweaks).

Ember 1.10 has been released. See this [blog post](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/02/07/ember-1-10-0-released.html). Since Ember 1.10 fixed my IE 8 issues with HTML5 tags, see [this post](http://vikingglory.com/articles/viking-base-update), I've updated the [Viking Base](https://github.com/jneurock/viking-base) project to include Ember 1.10 (as well as some minor API tweaks).

I've had a chance to test out the new build and it seems to be working great. This site has been updated already and the new HTMLBars compiler caught some issues the old Handlebars compiler did not. I've tested this site in IE 8 and verified that the HTML5 tags are working now.
