I've been working less and less on Viking Base and related projects these days. The Ember CLI project has grown to point where I can accomplish the same tasks I created Viking Base to do. Not to mention the fact that Ember's latest documentation release specifically refers to Ember CLI and the ES6 syntax and modular project structure that comes with it.

I imagine I'll retire the Viking Base project soon to avoid conflicting with newer Ember conventions. I also want to avoid rewriting Viking Base to line up with the ES6 stuff Ember has included.

I still prefer Gulp to Broccoli but it really isn't a big deal for me to personally switch. I think Ember CLI comes with enough cool features to make up for the small number of known issues. I plan to work on some Ember CLI add-ons, if need be. I could see the Viking Posts project as a good candidate.
