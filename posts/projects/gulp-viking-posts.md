Viking Posts is a gulp plugin meant to work with Viking Base to create lightweight JSON blog posts from Markdown files. The plugin can be used without Viking Base, too.

I just updated this site so I can generate all the posts with the plugin. You can find more information about the plugin at the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-viking-posts) and the source code can be found on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/jneurock/gulp-viking-posts).

Learn more about [gulp here](http://gulpjs.com/).
